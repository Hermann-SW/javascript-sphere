Default is "solid = false" mode left, where you see points that are not visible in case of a solid sphere. In that mode points not visible in case of a solid sphere are drawn in dark grey.  Mouse down switches to "solid = true", mouse up back to the other mode. The embedded tetrahedron (its vertices are on the sphere) is always drawn completely with white straint lines:
